Aim: - To implement histogram equalization of an image

Tools Used: - MatLab

Theory: - 
Histogram of a digital image with gray levels in range [0, L-1] is a discrete function h(rk) = nk where rk kth gray level and nk = no. of pixels of an image having gray level rk In histogram there are 3 possibilities as follows, 

For a dark image the components of histogram on the low (dark) side.
For a bright image the component are on high ( bright ) side &
For an image with low contrast they are in the middle of gray side.

Histogram equalization is done to spread there component uniformly over the gray scale as far as possible. This is obtained by function,
Sk=k=0L-1nkN

Thus processed image is obtained by mapping each pixel with level rk into a corresponding pixel with level Sk in o/p image. This transformation is called Histogram equalization

Algorithm: -

Read the i/p image & its size
Obtain the gray level values of each pixel & divide them by total number of gray level values.
Implement the function Sk
Plot the equalized histogram and original histogram.
Display the original and the new image.
